We recommend using secondary deployments, this project will lead to account prohibition, and I've already been prohibited two accounts.
## Uploading Code
Create a new space on huggingface, using Docker. Upload your `Dockerfile` and `README.md`.

## Environmental Variables 
One environmental variable is required `VNC_RESOLUTION`
The value can be 1024x768 or 1920x1080
Another secret environmental variable is needed, `VNC_PWD`
You need to remember its value yourself, which serves as the password.
